An e-commerce platform inspired by O'Reilly, implemented using Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA for the backend. React, JS, and TailWind CSS for the front end.

# Overview
This project is using an N-tier architecture, which divides the application into three logical layers: the presentation layer, the business layer, and the data layer. The presentation layer handles the user interface and interactions, while the business layer implements the application's logic and processes, and the data layer stores and retrieves data. By separating these layers, we can create a flexible and modular system that's easier to develop, test, and maintain.

## System Interaction Summary
1. Frontend Layer
Responsibility: Manages user interface and experience.
Interaction: Communicates with the backend through HTTP requests and updates the UI based on the responses.
2. Backend Layer
    1. Controller Layer
        1. Responsibility: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
        2. Interaction: Receives requests from the frontend, interacts with the service layer for data processing, and sends back responses.
    2. Service Layer
        1. Responsibility: Manages business logic and data processing.
        2. Interaction: Communicates with the controller layer and accesses/modifies data through the repository layer, utilizing models for data structure.
    3. Model Layer
        1. Responsibility: Defines data structures.
        2. Interaction: Used by the service and repository layers to define and manage data.
    4. Repository Layer
        1. Responsibility: Manages data access and CRUD operations.
        2. Interaction: Interacts with the database and the service layer, using models to manage data.
3. Auth Layer
    1. Responsibility: Secures rest endpoints.
    2. Interaction: Provides authentication settings (like security and JWT management) to the controller and service layers.

### Interaction Flow:
The Frontend Layer sends HTTP requests to the Controller Layer and receives responses to update the UI. The Controller Layer communicates with the Service Layer to process requests and manage business logic.
The Service Layer interacts with the Repository Layer to access and manage data in the database, utilizing the Model Layer for data structures. The Repository Layer performs CRUD operations directly on the Database. Both the Controller and Service Layers utilize configurations from the Auth Layer.

# Learnings
## Java

### Controllers
* Controllers should be as thin as possible, and they should only call at most one service layer method and not catch or throw exceptions.
* Delegate response code and error message responsibilities to a global exception handler. Exceptions should be called from the service layer which is intercepted by Spring exception handlers (ex: ControllerAdvice) where exceptions are then transformed into HTTP responses and returned to the client.
* Do not add business logic to this layer or have multiple calls within an endpoint, this is easier for testing purposes
* Validate input received in the request to ensure it is valid and meets the expected format.

### Services
* Modularity and reusability are key.
* Logging and HTTP responses should NOT be handled in the service layer. They should use exception propoagation to relay errors to the controller layer for proper logging and HTTP response translation.
* Exception handling should generally follow two rules:
    1. Some sort of recovery logic
    2. throw an api level exception to be handled by the controller layer
* Use DTOs to transfer data between the controller and the service. This helps keep the service layer decoupled from the controller layer and allows for better control over the data being transferred.

Ex: Propagating exceptions in the service layer
           
           @Service
           public class orderService {
                @Autowired
                private orderRepository orderRepository;

                pulbic Order createOrder(Order order) {
                    try {
                        Order createOrder = orderRepository.save(order);
                    } catch (specificException e) {
                        throw new ClientErrorException("Order already exists");
                    }
                }
           }
### Models
* They represent the data used by the service layer. Don't prematurely handle exceptions here.
* The only exceptions the model should handle are related to DB access. Propoage all other exceptions to the service layer.
* Use flyaway or something else for DB versioning for long term maintainability

### Client Libraries
* HTTP response codes should be converted into java exception types so the caller can hanlde the possible reponses a client call can return.


# Frontend
* Use localstorage/ sessionStorage / caching
* Minimize the amount of DB calls you need to make, networking limitations are real
* Managing state can be challenging, especially when you have lots of child components
* UseEffect is very commonly misused and error prone, there are lots of async calls which can be difficult to pin down, so you need to hanlde various states.
* Always check if the data structures (like arrays or objects) you're working with exist and have the expected format before performing operations on them. Functions like .map, .filter, and .reduce can throw errors if not used on actual arrays.
